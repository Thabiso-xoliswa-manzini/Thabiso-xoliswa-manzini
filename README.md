                                                                                                         His Journey

His story begins in the heart of KwaZulu-Natal, in Stenga, his mother name is Nqobile Mdluli, and his fathers name is Aaron Manzini. his family roots run deep in the vibrant community of KwaMhlabuyalingana, in the town of Manguzi, where he spent his formative years. It was there that he first learned the values of community perseverance, and the importance of a strong foundation.

his educational path began at Sizamnqubeko Combined School and continued at George Caltex Primary School and passed grade 7 in 2018 finishing primary school, laying the early groundwork for my academic journey. A significant step in his life was moving to start going to high school at  Star of the Sea High School in 2019, where my potential truly began to flourish. he worked diligently and was proud to pass with a Bachelor's pass in 2023.

The path to higher education is not always straight, and his journey included a pivotal gap year in 2024. This period was not a setback, but a time of growth and refocus, which made his acceptance to Nelson Mandela University (south campus) in 2025 all the more meaningful.

Stepping onto the campus ( NMU South Campus ) in Port Elizabeth marked the beginning of an exciting new chapter. he is currently pursuing a BA in Politics and Economics, a field that aligns perfectly with his passion for leadership and understanding the forces that shape our society.and is currently in resident at Claude Qavane Residence for the 2025 accademic year.

A defining moment of his first year was the opportunity to be interviewed on Madibaz Radio by Zanethemba Ntshanka. This incredible experience was made possible by the mentorship and encouragement of his primarius, Makhitha Mukundi, who saw his potential and was the reason he had the chance to work with Madibaz Ruby. It was a powerful lesson in how great leaders create opportunities for others to shine.

From the streets of Manguzi to the lecture halls of Nelson Mandela University, his journey has been shaped by every challenge, triumph, and mentor. he carryed the lessons from his family and his communities with him, and he is driven to make his mark through leadership, academic excellence, and a deep-seated desire to empower others, just as he was empowered.
